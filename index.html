        <p>Fatehgarh Sahib is a town and a sacred pilgrimage site of Sikhism in the north west Indian state of Punjab. 
        It is the headquarters of Fatehgarh Sahib district, located about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) north of Sirhind. 
        Fatehgarh Sahib is named after Fateh Singh, the 6-year-old son of Guru Gobind Singh, 
        who was seized and buried alive, along with his 9-year-old brother Zoravar Singh, 
        by the Mughals under the orders of governor Wazir Khan during the ongoing Mughal-Sikh wars of the 
        early 18th century. The town experienced major historical events after the martyrdom 
        of the sons in 1705, with frequent changes of control between the Sikhs and Mughals.

        The town features historic Gurdwaras, including the underground Bhora Sahib marking the location 
        where the two boys refused to convert to Islam and fearlessly accepted being bricked alive. 
        In contemporary times, the town is the site of educational institutions such as the SGPC run 
        Guru Granth Sahib University and Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Engineering College.</p>

                    The Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib is the major landmark in the town. 
                    It marks the location where two youngest sons of Guru Gobind Singh Ji – 7-year-old Fateh Singh 
                    and 9-year-old Zorawar Singh – were betrayed by their cook and servant Gangu to the Mughal army, 
                    seized, asked to convert to Islam and when they refused they were buried alive under the orders 
                    of Wazir Khan. </p>
